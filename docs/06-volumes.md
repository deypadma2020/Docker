# 6. Managing Data with Volumes

Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.

---

## ðŸ’µ Docker Volumes Commands

```bash
# List all volumes
docker volume ls

# Create a new volume
docker volume create my_volume

# Remove a volume
docker volume rm my_volume

# Remove all unused local volumes
docker volume prune
```

---

## ðŸ’¾ Types of Mounts

### Named Volume

This is the most common and recommended type of mount. Docker manages the volume on the host filesystem.

```bash
# Create a named volume and mount it into the container
docker run -v data_volume:/var/lib/mysql mysql
```

### Bind Mount

This mounts a file or directory from the host machine into the container. You must specify the full path on the host.

```bash
# Mount a host directory into a container
docker run -v /data/mysql:/var/lib/mysql mysql

# Example for Windows
docker run -it -v "C:\Users\Padma Dey\Desktop\data":/test/data ubuntu
```

### Anonymous Volume

If you only specify a path inside the container without a source, Docker creates an anonymous volume. These are harder to reference later.

```bash
# Creates an anonymous volume mounted at /mount_path
docker run -v /mount_path
```

---

## --mount Syntax

The `--mount` syntax is more explicit and verbose. It's the recommended syntax for clarity.

```bash
# Bind Mount
--mount type=bind,source=/data/mysql,target=/var/lib/mysql

# Named Volume
docker run --mount type=volume,src=<volume-name>,dst=<mount-path>
```

## | Storage Drivers

Docker uses storage drivers to manage the contents of the image layers and the writable container layer.

| Driver       | OS            |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| AUFS         | Ubuntu        |
| Overlay2     | Ubuntu/CentOS |
| ZFS          | Solaris/Linux |
| BTRFS        | Linux         |
| DeviceMapper | RHEL          |

You can check the active storage driver with:

```bash
docker info | grep "Storage Driver"
